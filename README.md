# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning

NLP deals with the use of human languages by a computer. [GBC16, p. 461] It has many different applications, which all refer to humansâ€™ unstructured natural language. For example, its application areas are machine translation, speech recognition,dialog systems, named entity recognition, information retrieval and text classification.Thus, the domain of NLP encompasses all interactions between a computer and a human,by the use of written or spoken natural language.

The difficulties of NLP consist of all components of natural language, such as 

* phonetics

* phonology:
This  is  the  study  of  how  speech  sounds  function  and  are  organised  in  a  particular  natural language.phonetics analyses the physical production of speech, independent of language

* morphology
The  smallest  meaningful  unit  in  the  grammar  of  a  language  is  called  a morpheme.This level then performs morphological decomposition of words into roots and affixes to infer their internal structure.

* syntax
This  level  infers  the  grammatical  structure  of  the  sentence,  that  is  the  structural  dependencies among the constituent words. It includes the tagging of the words with Part-of-Speech (POS) categories,for  example noun,verb and preposition.

The  word-POS  tag  sequences   grouped  with constituent parsing into phrases such as noun phrases(headed by a noun),verb phrases(headed by averb) and prepositional phrases(headed by a preposition).



* semantics 

* pragmatics


* Lexicology
Lexical analysis determines the underlying meaning or sense of individual words, typically bylookup in a dictionary called a lexicon.

All of these components must be taken into account in order to gain complete understanding of amessage
